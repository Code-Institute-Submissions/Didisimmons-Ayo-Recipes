Ayo Recipes is a modern recipe sharing website that caters to people of all ages. Its mission is to provide users with luxury cuisine food recipes in the comfort of their own home, eliminating the stress associated with pre-cooking.  At Ayo Recipes, we understand the hassle of cooking as well as the thought process involved in deciding on a specific meal to prepare .

Ayo Recipes provides users with simple recipes shared by our members, as well as coupons for kitchenware that makes cooking easier and more enjoyable. The user can easily search for a recipe category/recipe name, view its content, and order the meal from the page; however, the user must login/register to the site in order to see the order button, access cooking tips and tricks, and create their own recipe.

The goal of the site is for the user to be able to perform basic CRUD functionality(Create, Read, Update, and Delete) on the site and interact with it intuitively, having  a positive experience.
